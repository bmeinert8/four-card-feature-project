## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to use CSS Grid to create complex layouts, including a diamond formation for the feature cards on desktop screens. I also practiced using media queries to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

```css
/* Example of CSS Grid for diamond formation */
.card-section {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 1fr);
  gap: 2rem;
}

.supervisor-card {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  grid-row: 2 / 4;
}

.team-builder-card {
  grid-column: 3 / 4;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}

.karma-card {
  grid-column: 3 / 4;
  grid-row: 3 / 5;
}

.calculator-card {
  grid-column: 4 / 5;
  grid-row: 2 / 4;
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to continue improving my skills in CSS Grid and Flexbox to create more complex and responsive layouts. I also want to explore using CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS to speed up my development process.
